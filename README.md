# Portofolio-Website-HTML-CSS
I developed a portfolio website using HTML and CSS to revisit and reinforce fundamental web development concepts. This project helped me solidify my understanding of layout design, responsive web design techniques, and best practices in coding. The website showcases my skills, projects, and experience in a visually appealing and user-friendly manner, demonstrating my proficiency in front-end development. Through this exercise, I not only refreshed my knowledge but also created a professional online presence to highlight my capabilities and achievements.
